									<h2><a href="https://github.com/SaadADMalik/OMANI-Therapist-Voice">OMANI: AI-Powered Mental Wellness Companion</a></h2>
									<p>OMANI is an AI-powered therapeutic assistant designed to make mental health support more accessible and stigma-free. With a focus on empathetic listening, guided dialogue, and coping strategies, OMANI offers individuals a safe, non-judgmental space to share their thoughts and feelings at any time of the day. While it does not replace licensed therapy, it addresses a critical gap in accessibility: more than 70% of people worldwide experiencing stress or anxiety lack affordable or timely access to professional care. By offering conversational support that mimics the flow of a therapy session, OMANI helps users reflect on their emotions, track mood patterns, and build healthier mental resilience. Its real-world impact lies in providing scalable, always-available support that can complement traditional therapy models, reduce the stigma around seeking help, and potentially lower mental health–related productivity losses for organizations.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/SaadADMalik/Rag-Compliance-Chatbot">RAG Compliance Chatbot</a></h2>
									<p>It is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that automates compliance validation against PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, two of the most widely adopted global security standards. Traditional compliance audits are time-intensive and costly, often requiring teams to manually sift through thousands of policy documents — a process that can take weeks. CompliGuard reduces this effort to minutes. By ingesting and semantically chunking large policy PDFs (~81,000 words) and mapping them to compliance frameworks, it produces clear, auditable gap reports. This enables organizations to identify missing clauses, prioritize high-risk areas, and prepare for external audits with precision. In practical terms, this approach can help enterprises save up to 60–70% of the manual review time, lower the risk of audit failures that can cost millions in fines, and strengthen their overall security posture. Beyond time savings, CompliGuard provides executives with a living knowledge base — ensuring that compliance isn’t just a checkbox for audits but an active, ongoing safeguard against breaches and reputational damage.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/SaadADMalik/Patient-Readmission-Prediction-and-Risk-Mitigation-System">Real-Time Patient Readmission Prediction and Risk Mitigation System</a></h2>
									<p>Developed a robust machine learning solution to predict patient readmission risks within 30 days, leveraging a 1-million-row synthetic healthcare dataset. Engineered 10+ key features, including encounter duration and frequency, to train an XGBoost model achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.85, 70% precision, and 65% recall. Built a real-time Dash dashboard with 6 interactive visualizations (e.g., risk heatmaps, trend lines) and integrated a Flask API to deliver updates every 10 seconds, flagging 15% of patients as high-risk for intervention. The project, hosted on GitHub, demonstrates expertise in Python, data preprocessing, and scalable web deployment.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/SaadADMalik/Real-time-Earthquake-Monitoring-Dashboard">Real-Time Earthquake Monitoring Dashboard: Updates Every Hour</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I developed a real-time earthquake monitoring dashboard that processes and visualizes global seismic data, offering businesses and disaster management agencies actionable insights. The dataset contains over 200,000 rows and grows every hour as new data is ingested from the USGS API. Key metrics like total earthquake count, average magnitude, and regional earthquake trends are visualized through dynamic Power BI dashboards.

											Key Insights:
											Regions with the highest earthquake frequency, accounting for over 60% of global activity.
											
											10+ events with magnitudes exceeding 7.0.
											
											Seasonal trends showing a 15% increase in activity during certain periods.
											
											The project provides a comprehensive, real-time view of seismic activity, helping users make data-driven decisions. Explore the full project on GitHub for interactive charts and detailed insights.</p>
